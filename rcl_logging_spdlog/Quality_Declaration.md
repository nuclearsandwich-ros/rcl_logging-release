# `rcl_logging_spdlog` Quality Declaration

The package `rcl_logging_spdlog` claims to be in the **Quality Level 4** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Quality Categories in REP-2004](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#package-quality-categories) of the ROS2 developer guide.

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#versioning).

### Version Stability [1.ii]

Currently this package it is not at or above a stable version, i.e. `>= 1.0.0`.

### Public API Declaration [1.iii]

All symbols in the installed headers are considered part of the public API.

All installed headers are in the [include](./include/rcl_logging_spdlog) directory of the package, headers in any other folders are not installed and considered private.

### API Stability Policy [1.iv]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` will not break public API within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.

### ABI Stability Policy [1.v]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` contains C code and therefore must be concerned with ABI stability, and will maintain ABI stability within a ROS distribution.

### ABI and ABI Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.vi]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` will not break API nor ABI within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.

## Change Control Process [2]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` follows the recommended guidelines for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#change-control-process).

### Change Requests [2.i]

All changes will occur through a pull request, check [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#change-control-process) for additional information.

### Contributor Origin [2.ii]

This package uses DCO as its confirmation of contributor origin policy. More information can be found in [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Peer Review Policy [2.iii]

Following the recommended guidelines in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#change-control-process) all pull requests must have at least 1 peer review.

### Continuous Integration [2.iv]

All pull requests must pass CI on all [tier 1 platforms](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers)

Currently nightly results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_logging_spdlog/)
* [linux_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_logging_spdlog/)

* [windows_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_win_rel/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_logging_spdlog/)

###  Documentation Policy [2.v]

All pull requests must resolve related documentation changes before merging.

## Documentation [3]

### Feature Documentation [3.i]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` does not have feature documentation.

### Public API Documentation [3.ii]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` does not have public API documentation.

### License [3.iii]

The license for `rcl_logging_spdlog` is Apache 2.0, and a summary is in each source file, the type is declared in the [`package.xml`](./package.xml) manifest file, and a full copy of the license is in the [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) file.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has a license statement. [Here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_logging_spdlog/) can be found a list with the latest results of the various linters being run on the package.

### Copyright Statements [3.iv]

The copyright holders each provide a statement of copyright in each source code file in `rcl_logging_spdlog`.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement. Latest linter result report can be seen [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_logging_spdlog/copyright/).

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` does not include feature testing.

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` does not include Public API testing.

### Coverage [4.iii]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` does not include tests, so coverage is not provided.

### Performance [4.iv]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` does not conduct performance tests.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`rcl_logging_spdlog` uses and passes all the standard linters and static analysis tools for a C package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#linters-and-static-analysis). Passing implies there are no linter/static errors when testing against CI of supported platforms.
